## About

Tribeca is an open source protocol for launching decentralized autonomous organizations on Solana. It is heavily inspired by the designs of [Compound](https://compound.finance/docs/governance) and [Curve](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html) governance.

- **Built with Anchor.** Tribeca is pluggable with other Anchor-based projects and tools, allowing for greater composability.
- **Modularity.** Tribeca is built to be flexible and extensible, splitting out proposals/voting, transaction execution, and staking into three separate programs.
- **Hosted.** The Tribeca DAO program is meant to be deployed as one instance of a program, similar to the [SPL Token Program](https://spl.solana.com/token). It is an open standard that any other project can build upon, without requiring teams to deploy their own DAO or giving custody of user tokens to Tribeca.
- **Simplicity.** Tribeca does as little as possible, giving DAOs the freedom to choose how their governance system operates.
